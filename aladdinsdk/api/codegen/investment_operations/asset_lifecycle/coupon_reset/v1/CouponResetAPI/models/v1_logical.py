    Logical operators apply to boolean values and yield a result of the same type as the operands. The right operand is evaluated conditionally. To match common patterns of speech, the OR operator has higher precedence than AND, unlike what is found in most programming languages. The expression a AND b OR c evaluates: a AND (b OR c).   - LOGICAL_UNSPECIFIED: Default value  - LOGICAL_OR: LOGICAL_OR indicates an OR condition. If any of the two operands is true, then condition becomes true, otherwise it is false.  - LOGICAL_AND: LOGICAL_AND indicates an AND condition. If both the operands are true, then condition becomes true, othwerwise it is false.  - LOGICAL_NOT: LOGICAL_NOT indicates a NOT condition. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.
